## Features

- **Zero-install**: Run directly with a single `npx` command. Automatically detects the installation path and restarts the app.
- **Non-invasive**: Translates only the shell UI and native menus. Code editors (Monaco), terminals (xterm), and LLM conversation areas remain completely untouched.
- **Byte-exact restore**: Backs up the original `app.asar` on first run. Run `en` at any time to restore the official pristine files.
- **Offline & private**: Zero network requests, zero telemetry, and no access to tokens, sessions, or credentials.
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes 600+ static UI labels, 28+ native menu items, and dynamic status text patterns (e.g. `Thought for 5s`).

## Notes

1. **Save your work**: The tool waits up to 20 seconds for the app to exit cleanly and save state. It is recommended to save unfinished work before running.
2. **Official updates**: Official updates overwrite `app.asar`. Simply run `npx antigravity-zh zh` again after updating.
3. **Backup files**: The initial run creates `app.asar.clean-backup` in the `resources` directory as the baseline for restoration. Do not delete it manually.
